# terraform-demo
A simple project showcasing the power of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform to provision, configure and manage a containerized 3-tier application locally with Docker.

## Architecture
```
graph TD;
    subgraph Host-Maschine
        User -- "HTTP-Request http://localhost:8080" --> Nginx;
    end

    subgraph "Docker-Netzwerk (app_network)"
        Nginx -- "/api (Reverse Proxy)" --> NodeJS;
        NodeJS -- "DB-Connection with Credentials (env)" --> Postgres;
    end

    subgraph Legende
        Nginx["Frontend (Nginx-Container)"];
        NodeJS["⚙Backend (Node.js-API-Container)"];
        Postgres["🗄Datenbank (PostgreSQL-Container)"];
    end
```
- Frontend: Nginx container that delivers a static HTML page and serves as a reverse proxy for the API requests.
- Backend: Custom Node.js/Express application (Docker image is built by Terraform). It provides a `/status` endpoint that checks the connection to the database.
- Database: Standard PostgreSQL container.

## Requirements
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)

## Installation and Usage
### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone <URL-des-Projekts>
cd <projekt-verzeichnis>
```

### 2. initialize Terraform 
This command loads necessary providers (docker and random).
```bash
terraform init
```

### 3. Check execution plan optional
Take a look at what Terraform will do (create/change/delete) before it actually does anything.
```bash
terraform plan
```
You will see that 5 resources are created: the password, the Docker image and the three containers.

### 4. Apply Infrastructure
This command executes the plan. It will build the Docker image and start all containers in the correct order.
```bash
terraform apply
```

### 5. Verify Success
- Browser: Open [http://localhost:8080](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:8080&authuser=3). The page should load and after a short moment the status should change to `DB Connection: ✅ Connected!`.
- Terminal: Check running containers `docker ps`. You should see the three containers `app-frontend`, `backend-api` and `app-database`.

### 6. Clean Up
This command destroys all resources created by Terraform (containers, network).
```bash
terraform destroy
```

```

## Detailed Breakdown
This demo shows the intelligent linking of the components by Terraform:
- Random password: random_password provider generates a new password for the DB with every apply.
- Automatic networking: Terraform creates an isolated Docker network. Containers can find each other via their names (e.g. backend-api).
- Dynamic configuration: Terraform injects the connection data (the host name of DB container and generated password) as environment variables (DB_HOST, DB_PASSWORD) into backend container. Node.js application reads these variables at startup to connect to database.
- Custom image build: Terraform automatically builds the Docker image for backend API from the Dockerfile in the backend-app directory.
